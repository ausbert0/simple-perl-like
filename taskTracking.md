__things to do__
1) make the parser actually work lmao
    - making and reading parse tree no worky
        - seeming like i must rebuild the parse tree
        - allocate memory for every parsing thingy
    - parsing grammar is mostly fine, might do adjustments (aspirational)
2) interpreter
    - this will be fun and i have very little clue on how i will handle this
3) MAYBE make a list of tokens instead of lexing on-demand
